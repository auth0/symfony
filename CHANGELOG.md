[Full Changelog](https://github.com/auth0/symfony/compare/4.0.0...5.0.0)

We are excited to announce the release of V5.0 of Auth0's Symfony SDK! This version is a complete rewrite of our Symfony bundle, and includes full support for PHP 8.1 and Symfony 6.1. It also includes numerous new features and greatly expanded functionality, including:

- Plug-and-play route controllers to instantly add Auth0 authentication to your Symfony application
- Expanded route authorization support
- Support for Symfony's new Guard APIs
- Improved performance and stability
- Full integration with v8 of the [Auth0-PHP SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP) and all of its features, including Management APIs, passwordless, and more

This release represents a significant upgrade to the API of our bundle, and we'd encourage you to refer to our updated [README.md](README.md) for usage of the new release, and guidance on upgrading your Symfony application. We hope you enjoy this new version and all the features it has to offer. Thank you for using Auth0!

> **Note:** As of this release, we have renamed the package to `auth0/symfony` (previously `auth0/jwt-auth-bundle`) so as to better clarify the elevated functionality of the SDK into a full Auth0 integration with this release. We have marked the `auth0/jwt-auth-bundle` package as deprecated with Packagist to inform customers of this change. Simply update your `composer.json` to reference the new package name to continue receiving updates.
